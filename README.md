**Overview**

Manually downloading and processing crop and commodity price and arrival data for Karnataka or India can be tedious and time-consuming. The data available on platforms like **Agmarknet** and **Krishi Marata Vahini** is often segmented by year or market, requiring multiple downloads, file merges, and formatting adjustments before analysis can begin.

To simplify this process, these **web scrapers** were developed to **automate data collection and preprocessing.** The scripts automatically fetch, clean, and consolidate the data into a single, ready-to-use file — significantly reducing manual effort and improving productivity.


**-Agmarknet Scraper:** Collects all-India commodity data.


**-Krishi Marata Vahini Scraper:** Collects Karnataka-specific commodity data.


Users can easily run these scrapers to streamline their workflow and focus more on analysis rather than data preparation
